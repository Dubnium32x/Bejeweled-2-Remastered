### Summary
The animation transitions through three states: initial, view, and final. Each state has specific properties for scale, opacity, and overall scale, which create a dynamic visual effect. The initial state starts flat and invisible, the view state inflates and becomes fully visible, scales up and down a bit for a second, and then transitions to the final state which returns to an invisible state with reduced overall scale.
